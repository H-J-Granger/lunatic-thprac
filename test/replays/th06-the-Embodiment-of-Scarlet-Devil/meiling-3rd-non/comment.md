### Silent deaths

These replays show strange dying behaviour in Meiling's third non-spell: getting hit by the blue kunai in the first wave of Meiling's third non-spell, without any sound.

- silent-death-Easy: a replay showing this behaviour in Easy mode;
- silent-death-Normal: as above, but in Normal;
- silent-death-Hard: as above, but in Hard;
- silent-death-Lunatic: as above, but in Lunatic.

### Different heights

These replays show different behaviour above Meiling's head.

- normal-hit-by-kunai: as the filename suggests.
- silent-hit-by-kunai: as above, but without any dying sound effect.
- fake-safespot: a safespot that doesn't exist in the vanilla game (there could be a chance that this safespot does exist but in a different region).
- normal-hit-by-Meiling: as the filename suggests.
